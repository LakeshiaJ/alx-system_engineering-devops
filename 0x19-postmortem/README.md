Issue Summary:
May 10, 2022, 2:30 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. (WAT), In
our e-commerce site experienced a total failure.
The website stopped responding and users could not access it during this time.
Impact:
The outage affected all services provided on the website, including the product listing, the shopping cart function and the checkout process. All users trying to access the site have encountered error messages or an unresponsive page. We estimate that around 80% of our users were affected by the outage.

Root Cause:


AfroFarm
The purpose of your project
AfroFarm is a system inspired by the market gap due to the lack of a system linking real small farmers/global market and investors to help small farmers with their actual weather data according to their locations and links them to the global market to achieve perfect productivity and rewarding returns.

 A brief story about our interest in this project
The great thing about us, are we in love with dealing with data. We want the programmers to come up with a program that can help most producers or consumers make bills, compare and maintain an analysis.
Target
Goal Their owners and managers to carry out a large number of basic daily tasks, including managing and tracking farmers' information, accounting and invoices, and publishing vacancies on the Internet to help all operations work smoothly.
Personal focus
Helping community owners and managers to easily manage their products and consumers through this web.
 lessons learned
Lessons are used. The problem is designed by determining a logical sequence of the steps that will achieve both the declared system goals. The sequence of steps is often indicated that it is the algorithm of some methods used to determine the program algorithms that are later described in this section, and they include flowcharts and pseudo code.
You have learned how to publish Heroku, how to check the login page, how to make perceptions, and how to set the database. This project helped me realize that I got more projects to do to form my skills.
Tell a story about yourself related to why you chose to work on this project
After I have seen many technologies via various platforms over the years, especially the web. It is very interesting to train to know and use this technology. This is what ALX did to me and now I want to use knowledge to build something that will be useful if not for everyone but at least for myself.
After I have taken many reading, study, practice, and projects in ALX over the past 8 months, it is time to build. It is worth noting to know the low human relationship and human response, especially in the estimation of others. Despite the increase in the use of social media, this innate human need is not satisfied. This may often attribute to "busy" for most individuals.
But can we make things better? Yes. This is why I decided to make a contribution to the solution by building the Afrfarm application.

About Me
My love for technology, especially the software design unit (C ++ programming), made me a long adventure in working with electrical devices, mobile phones, computers, and later software. This is what brought me to software engineering also in ALX.
I always liked to use technology to build and provide solutions using technology. ALX Software Engineering has provided skills in software engineering and all its relevant skills. This will be very valuable in this portfolio blog.
Human time is limited, as well as the time we have with ourselves. Also, knowing that human relations are very important, it will be great to cherish and increase every part of it. Appreciation is one of the ways that human relations can be strengthened and secured for a long time.
Summarize what you accomplished with your project
At work in this project, my achievement is the relationship with how to communicate with myself in dealing with projects that create our goals, how to communicate within ourselves, cooperate, listen to each other's suggestions, resolve conflicts, ability to adapt, organize, and accept constructive comments.
Well, my role was a little difficult to income because I had to do more research before I understood what I was doing.
I had to be very effective to make sure I wouldn't overcome it. "


The most important part of making this work was proactive. If you have just rolled with punches and focused on extinguishing fires, the whole thing has turned into quick chaos. At the beginning of the project, I created a very strict schedule and adhered to it 100 %. I have also started a search system for more knowledge and understanding of what is required.
In general, the project marked well with minimal accidents.
Write about the most difficult artistic challenge in the depth
With the current system registration, the details of the user's different activities are completely manual and require a lot of paperwork. The system only provides a text-based interface that is not easy to use like a graphic user interface. Transactions are unsafe because the leaves may be lost or damaged.
The Mistakes
     Make jobs do a lot
     Using magic chains
     Place the third-party applications program, I don't know anything
     Fruit feature
     Compare my code with online videos that I have seen.
     Determine a lot of jobs
This made my code contains many red lines and errors that are waiting to be fixed, which took a lot of my time to correct. This error was mostly laziness. I wrote jobs that were very big, I did a lot, and I knew things that they had no knowledge of. It turns out that this trap is easy to reach when it dives into the coding without great planning
